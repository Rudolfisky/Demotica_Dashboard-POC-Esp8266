# conclusion/sensor
after having tried both DHT and DS sensors, i have concluded the following:
even though the DHT sensor has the capability to mesure temperature as wel as air moisture levels, it is only acurate to 2.5 degrees celcius.
the DS sensor is acurate to 0.5.
in conclusion, i am going to continue with the DS for now

# app/MQTT pub
the mqtt pub project connects to my local wifi network and my Mosquito mqtt server i have running on my laptop.
